                                            my name is John Giannelos and I am going to talk tou you about satnogs.
                                            SatNOGS started as a project in Athens Hackerspace and now consists of satellite enthusiasts all around the world.
                                            And as satellite enthusiasts we are hunting satellites.
                                            Specifically the signals of them.
                                            That's way we created SatNOGS.

                                    SatNOGS is a global network of satellite ground stations.
                                    But let's start with the basics.

                                                          One really interesting category for us are cubesats.

                                            Cubesats are small satelites, size 10x10x10cm that can be easily constructed using of the self hardware.

                                            Radio bands: non encrypted, free to air, scientific payloads, status beacons.

That means that for those that want to listen to them, they only have a short overpassing time window (for a specific location).

                                                          In order to listen to satellites we use ground stations.
                                                          A ground station is basically antennas mounted to a rotator that can track the position of the satellite in the sky and receive the signal for a specific frequency.

                                                          As you can see, ground stations like this can be super expensive and under heavy regulations, so,
                                                          In order to tackle this problem, the first thing that we needed to solve this was to provide an open source cheap reference design. But that could only solve the cost issue, but we wanted also to address the global coverage issue.

                                      When we came up with the initial architecture we found out that there was no unified way to do this. So we decided to create everything from scratch. This is not an easy task so we focused on implementing everything in a modular way. Specifically we wanted to reuse existing components to tackle the initial problem.

                                     Let's dive into our stack.

                                            We also provide a design for permanent setups using a radome. This is an optional one mostly usefull for extreme weather conditions.

                                                          An interesting issue that we encountered was that there was no source to get satellite's transceiver data. Transceiver data = Frequency, Modulation, Baud rate etc. That's why we created satnogs db, a crowdsourced satellite transceiver database based on community's contributions.

                                      So overally our stack looks like this.
                                      You can use different combinations of antennas (yagi, helical, uhf, vhf)
                                      You can either mount it to our reference design or nay commercial rotator.
                                      On the client side you can use the embedded platform that you want (beaglebone green).
                                      Then you could either run SatNOGS client to orchestrate the satellite tracking, other commercial software or their open source implementations. Finally you can decide if you want to send the data back to the network or just use the ground station offline.

                                    As you can understand, this is a really complicated problem that we are trying to tackle and wouldn't be possible to achieve anything without the community help. Here you can see pictures from ground stations being build from contributors all around the world.

                                    Through mingling with the open space enthusiasts all around the world it was clear that we could not onlyadvance our open source ideals to just communicating with satellites. That's why we created libre space foundation.
